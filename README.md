ðŸ‘‹ Hello world! I'm Malwina - a Fullstack Developer!

ðŸš€ My journey into programming began during a 7-day marathon with CSS and HTML, where I realized my love for solving problems through creativity! Now, as a Fullstack Developer, I leverage my skills to craft innovative solutions.

ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm participating in a Full Stack course, acquiring the skills needed for effective work on the front and back ends of web applications.

ðŸ’» My main tools include JavaScript, React, CSS3, HTML5. I've already completed modules covering JavaScript, React, CSS3, HTML5, and I'm currently diving into Node.js to broaden my backend knowledge.

ðŸ“š My previous profession was as a personal trainer and nutrition specialist, adding a unique perspective on health and physical well-being to my approach to programming.

ðŸŒŸ If you have any questions, ideas, or would like to discuss collaboration, feel free to reach out!

Happy coding! ðŸš€âœ¨
